# Gutenberg

An analysis of the books from Project Gutenberg, in order to prove a new formulation of the Zipf-Mandelbrot law for
word frequencies in human text which argues that spaces and other forms of punctuation should count as words. Uses Maximum Likelihood Estimations (MLE) and map reduce to achieve the desired results.
Was the basis for a currently unpublished paper, found here:
