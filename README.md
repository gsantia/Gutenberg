# Gutenberg Word Counts Tool

A tool for the analysis of the books from Project Gutenberg, in order to prove a new formulation of the Zipf-Mandelbrot law for
word frequencies in human text. The new formulation argues that spaces and other forms of punctuation should count as words. Uses Maximum Likelihood Estimations (MLE) and map reduce.

The basis for a currently unpublished paper, found here:
